## What's this?

This is the repository of Payment Connector documentation, made using OpenApi specs.
The magic here is: a n index files with a few custom js code, a little SwaggerUI css and js files catch the .yaml file with OAS (OpenAPI Specification) and render a [page](https://send4br.github.io/openapi-payment-connector-ui.github.io/), turning the boring documentation into something more interactive.

## How this is possible?

Thankfully with GitHub Pages, which allow us to create a page using a repository as a host

## How this was made?

A huge help of [this article](https://pguso.medium.com/host-openapi-documentation-with-github-pages-ec16f75e9762) and this [readme file](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md) from SwaggerUI repository
